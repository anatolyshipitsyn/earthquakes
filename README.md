```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for all applications using `pnpm`:

```bash

```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Environment variables must be configured for each application. Copy the provided `.env.example` files and populate them:

```bash
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env

**Note**: Populate placeholders in the `.env` files with environment-specific values (e.g., database credentials, API
keys).

## Running the Application

There are two ways to start the application:

### Option A: Using Docker

Launch the application in a fully containerized environment:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```


### Option B: Manual Start

#### 1. Start Database and Redis
Make sure the required services (database and Redis) are running locally.

Alternatively, you can start them using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up db redis
```

#### 2. Start the Backend (GraphQL API)
Set up environment variables and run the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
pnpm --filter=backend run dev
```

#### Start the Frontend

Set up environment variables and run the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
nvm use && pnpm --filter=frontend run dev
```

The application will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**
